        Behold, the great and mighty Spaghetti-O's Jell-O abomination!
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cans of Spaghetti-O's</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of condensed tomato soup</li>
            <li>2 (1/4 ounce) packets of Jell-O, preferably red</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Directions:</strong>
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the water and the tomato soup in a large saucepan on medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Gently stir as you mix in the gelatin. Continue stirring slowly for 5 minutes. Continue stirring until there are no lumps of gelatin.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into your jello mold. Refrigerate for 4-5 hours at least.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to serve this, you can use warm water to loosen the cake from the mold. This may not work as well if youâ€™re using a silicone mold, you will need to make sure the water is really hot if you want it to get through the silicone.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! I kind of doubt anyone actually will, but I can always hope..</li>
        </ol>
